# Hacks of Mistria

**Hacks of Mistria** is an editor tool for your saves in Fields of Mistria. You can download the latest version in the [releases](https://github.com/arkatsy/hacks-of-mistria/releases)

Please note that while I'm doing my best to make sure you don't ruin your saves, you're still taking a risk. Make sure to backup your saves first.<br />
Your saves are under `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Local\FieldsOfMistria\saves`. Just make a copy of the `saves` folder under a different name or put it somewhere else.<br />
There are plans to add a backup feature in the tool to make it easier but I haven't worked on it yet.

‼️**Please don't skip the backup step. I can't stress this enough**‼️

While you can do some fun stuff you couldn't otherwise do, please be mindful, especially when editing the inventory. Adding items / infusions / stacking that wouldn't be possible in the game normally can break a save. If this happens and you can't load your save in game, just edit your save again and remove the problematic item that's causing it. <br />
Also note that there could be some items that are problematic themselves. If there is an item that breaks the save without any infusion or stacking please let me know!
